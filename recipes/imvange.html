        <p> 
            This dish is an african disch, also know imvange is is prepared in potatoes
            .I first have to peal the potatoes using knife.
             Coution: to be careful not to
            cut my self while using the knife during peeling process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All igredient have to be ready before cooking. the ingredients
            oil,salt,tomatoes, carrots, onions to have it delicious.
            I also have to prepare all the materials first such as the sauce-pan
            and other relevant materials. 
           
         1. First, grab 1 extra-large potato, 2 large potatoes or 3 medium potatoes equalling about 315 grams. Rinse well in water and then peel the potato.Peeling the potato is optional. While I know some people like the skin on their french fries, I find that it creates a tough exterior. I personally prefer my finger chips to be bare and tender.

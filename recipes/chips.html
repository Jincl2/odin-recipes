            My favorite food ever, Chips. Height 300, width, 250!
        </h2>
        <p> 
            This chips, also know as Frenchfries is is prepared in potatoes
            .I first have to peal the potatoes using knife.
             Coution: to be careful not to
            cut my self. If you have a hankering for crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, perfectly salted French Fries, then look no further. I have a homemade Finger Chips recipe that will rival anything the fast food chains can offer, all from the comfort of your own home. I share both the classic deep frying method and the healthier air fried technique to make everyoneâ€™s favorite French Fries

            all igredient have to be ready before cooking. the ingredients
            oil, salt, eggs, onions to have it delicious.
            I also have to prepare all the materials first such as the saucepan
            and other relevant materials. 
           
         1. First, grab 1 extra-large potato, 2 large potatoes or 3 medium potatoes equalling about 315 grams. Rinse well in water and then peel the potato.Peeling the potato is optional. While I know some people like the skin on their french fries, I find that it creates a tough exterior. I personally prefer my finger chips to be bare and tender.
